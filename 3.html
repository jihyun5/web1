  <p>Dim sum is a large range of small dishes that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese_people" target="_blank" title="Cantonese people">Cantonese people</a> traditionally enjoy in restaurants for breakfast and lunch.In the tenth century, when the city of Guangzhou (Canton) began to experience an increase in commercial travel, travelers concurrently began to frequent teahouses for small-portion meals with tea called yum cha, or <strong>"drink tea"</strong> meals.Yum cha includes two related concepts. The first is "yat jung leung gin" , which translates literally as <strong>"one cup, two pieces"</strong>. This refers to the custom of serving teahouse customers two pieces of delicately made food items, savory or sweet, to complement their tea. The second is dim sum and translates literally to "touching heart", the term used to designate the small food items that accompanied the tea drinking.</p><p>Teahouse owners gradually added various snacks called "dim sum" to their offerings. The practice of having tea with dim sum eventually evolved into the modern yum cha (brunch).Cantonese dim sum culture developed rapidly during the latter half of the nineteenth century in Guangzhou.Cantonese dim sum was based originally on local foods.As dim sum continued to develop, chefs introduced influences and traditions from other regions of China and this was the start of a wide variety of dim sum.</p><p>There are over one thousand dim sum dishes in existence today.Cantonese dim sum has a very broad range of flavors, textures, cooking styles and ingredients,and can be classified into regular items, seasonal offerings, weekly specials, banquet dishes, holiday dishes, house signature dishes, travel-friendly, as well as breakfast or lunch foods and late night snacks.</P>
